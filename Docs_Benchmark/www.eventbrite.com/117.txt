I'm Jeannine Carson and I make colorful, small batch pottery items that fit easily into modern living spaces. Everyone has that favorite mug, the one they use every morning to savor their first cup of coffee or tea. It becomes a part of their daily ritual. The mug relegated to the favored position is usually determined, whether consciously or not, by the user’s preference to the color, the shape and the texture of the pot itself.  People choose colors that make us happy, a weight and surface that feels good in the hand or on the lip as well as a pot that functions well.  It holds the perfect amount, has a rim that feels good against the lip and a shape that fits easily in the hand.  This fact is exhilarating to me as an artist because it means there exists an infinite number of combinations, interactions and possibilities to pursue in clay.
