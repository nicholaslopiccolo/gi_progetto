43rd Annual Thunderbird American Indian Powwow Tickets, Floral Park | Eventbrite
--no date--

Celebrate American Indian Culture through music, dance, Native American crafts and food. This spectacular 3-day powwow features intertribal Native American dance competitions by over forty Indian Nations. Program features an expansive market of  authentic Native American art, crafts, jewelry and food (don’t miss the fry bread!). The Thunderbird American Indian Powwow is an experience not to be missed, connecting the public to ancient Native American traditions and cultures and to each other.
The Powwow includes 6 major dance categories for competing dancers. In addition, there are several other non-competitive dances such as Gourd Dance, Round Dance, Rabbit Dance, and demonstrations of various Iroquois, Pueblo and Apache dances. Each dance’s significance is explained to the public. The Grand Entry is a spectacular moment to experience the full regalia of these dancers. The bonfire on Friday and Saturday evenings is the culmination of these beautiful programs, where the audience is invited to join the dance circle. The bonfire is lit Friday and Saturday at dusk between 8:00 pm–9:00 pm.
Dance and music have always been a central part of Native American culture.  Powwows are social gatherings where friends and family can enjoy each other’s company, often after many months of separation. Join us as we all have a chance to reconnect again.
