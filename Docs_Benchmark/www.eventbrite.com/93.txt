TOM DURANTE “A City Unseen” SOLO NFT EXHIBITION Tickets, Sat, Jun 25, 2022 at 6:00 PM | Eventbrite
Sat, June 25, 2022, 6:00 PM – 9:00 PM EDT

New York City is labeled as the most photographed place in the entire world, yet a majority of its views remain inaccessible and undocumented. With nothing but a camera, a little bit of curiosity, and a desire to create the most expansive body of work around the Manhattan skyline that I could, "A City Unseen" took shape.
“A City Unseen” is an ongoing 10 year curation of photographs documenting the ever-evolving city of New York and the adventures it took to do so.
From 6-9 PM on June 25th, Superchief Gallery NFT is hosting the first ever showing of the “A City Unseen” project with a live auction for the first available piece. This 2 hour exhibition will be the first place to display a variety of Tom Durante’s unreleased photographs along with many coming to “A City Unseen.”
! FREE BEER !
