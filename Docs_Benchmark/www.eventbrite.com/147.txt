JUNE 21, 2022: Web3 & Education
For the month of June,
we're making an exception to our monthly "first Tuesdays" schedule in honor of NFTNYC.  Meet Ed3 Educators (@ed3educators) -- the first NFT collection supporting web3 education for educators. If we want our future generation to be prepared for the age of innovation, our educators and schools must be well versed in web3! This NFT collection powers the first DAO for educators and a free metaverse space for educators.
HOSTED BY:
Ed3 DAO
&
k20 Educators
______
Join us in celebrating the launch of Ed3 Educators NFT, live in NYC. We'll chat about the evolution of education with speakers from Rabbithole, Crypto Culture & Society DAO, and Ed3 DAO.
​Open bar and snacks! We'll also raffle off some NFTs, give out swag to holders, and enjoy an open bar!
