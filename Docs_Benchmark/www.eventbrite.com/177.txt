Midnight Market is an exciting take on the classic night market scene. This year we are operating two event sessions to stay safe and socially distant.  We are excited to pop up at
902 Brewing Co
for an
indoor/outdoor event
in Jersey City.
Bring your crew, bring a date, or just bring yourself.
The most important thing is that you bring your appetite!

Foodies can turn down the volume of their headphones or take them off whenever they want to chat with others. Since there are no blaring speakers, it's easier to have conversations, order food & drinks, and MEET NEW PEOPLE!
This is a foodie dance party, so there's limited seating... wear comfy shoes and bring your Megan Knees.  Eat good food, dance it off, and go for round two!
