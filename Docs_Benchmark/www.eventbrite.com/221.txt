Great Ambiance, Not to mention equally beautiful people & music. BluVino is not a “Wine Tasting” event in it’s purest form but rather a sexy, intimate soiree that strives to seduce both the casual and serious wine enthusiasts to indulge and explore their “vino palette”, in a fun-loving party atmosphere that encourages wine discovery & experimentation with wine selections spanning both local, regional and international vineyards.

For those unfamiliar, BluVino is a wine event, and we mean that literally... here are some tidbits to help you get acquainted

Wine is sold by the bottle only
We will have various selections of both red and white wines for sale
There will be complimentary appetizers/wine pairings
We will have a Wine Expert available early on to both educate and assist guests in selecting wines
This is not a wine tasting in it's purest form, its an all out party where only wine is served, however we do take time to gently introduce newcomers to the wonderful world of Vino
Trendy, Chic, Classy yet comfortable attire is encouraged
This is a day party please try to come early to get the most enjoyment out of the event (3:00 pm - 8:30 pm)
