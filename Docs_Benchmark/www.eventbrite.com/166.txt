What is Christmas in July? According to legend, Christmas in July was first celebrated at a summer camp in 1933, when Keystone Camp in Brevard, N.C. decided to dedicate two days (July 24 and 25) to the holiday—complete with cotton fake snow, a decked-out tree, a gift exchange, and, of course, Santa.
So let's celebrate with Christmas in July Trivia at Schmitty’s in Hoboken on Tuesday, July 5 at 7:30pm. We'll be covering all things pertaining to Christmas!

The best way to reserve tickets is by selecting a team captain and having them be in charge of tickets for ALL team members.
For example, if Santa, Mrs. Claus, Rudolph and Buffy the Elf are on a team and Mrs. Claus gets put in charge, she will then reserve tickets for herself, Santa, Rudolph and Buffy the Elf = (4) in total.
PLEASE ONLY RESERVE SINGLE TICKETS IF YOU ARE PLAYING BY YOURSELF.
We will send a confirmation email to everyone closer to the event.
