A monthly series in the heart of Uptown NYC. It brings artists, merchants, creators, inventors, designers, and visionaries together in one dope AF space - 125th st. - where they can share allllllllll the goodness with the thriving Uptown community and anyone from the greater NY that wants to soak in the cool. Expect the most banging flavors, the hottest merchandise, incredibly crafted items, dope art, fresh designs, and much more. HARLEM BAZAAR, the largest arts & culture fair in uptown, aims to give female, POC, LGBTQIA, and immigrant vendors an opportunity to showcase their chops.
Join us on the Third Friday of the Month through October on 125th Street, right smack down in Harlem. You BEST be there! And, yes, of course, there will be some good food from NYC's most popular chefs and vendors.
