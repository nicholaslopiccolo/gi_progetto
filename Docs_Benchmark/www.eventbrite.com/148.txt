STATEMENT
“Light has come into the world, but people loved darkness instead of light because their deeds were evil. While I am in the world, I am the light of the world…
Johannine Dualism.”
The world in general is dark enough, with our art let us be the positive catalysts to generate the transformation of life. We have created this art show to bring more light to this world while celebrating the lighter side of the life.
