The best way to reserve tickets is by selecting a team captain and having them be in charge of tickets for ALL team members.
For example, if Harry Potter, Ron Weasley, Hermione Granger and Draco Malfoy are a team and Hermione gets put in charge, she will then reserve tickets for herself, Harry, Ron and Draco = (4) in total.
PLEASE ONLY RESERVE SINGLE TICKETS IF YOU ARE PLAYING BY YOURSELF.
We will send a confirmation email to everyone closer to the event.
