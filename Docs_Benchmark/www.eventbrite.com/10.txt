Sat, June 25, 2022, 5:00 PM – 10:00 PM EDT

Get ready for the return of Brooklyn’s most magical gathering—
the Prospect Park Soiree!
We provide the entertainment and breathtaking setting, while you gather with thousands of friends—new and old—to enjoy an evening under the stars in Prospect Park.
Wear your most festive attire, prepare a delicious feast, bring your favorite bottle of wine, and dine and dance under the stars in one of Prospect Park’s most scenic locations. Show off your creativity with a show-stopping topper—a fabulous hat or headpiece of your choosing—as well as table décor that celebrates the beautiful surroundings, and raise your glass in a toast to Brooklyn's Backyard.
Individual tickets are  $55. A limited number of party packs of 10 tickets will be available that include two complimentary bottles of wine.
Proceeds benefit Prospect Park Alliance, the non-profit organization that sustains, restores and advances Prospect Park for the benefit of the diverse communities that call Brooklyn home.
