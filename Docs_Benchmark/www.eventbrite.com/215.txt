So True, Bestie (A Queer Comedy Show & Social Hour) Tickets, Multiple Dates | Eventbrite
--no date--

Laughing at ourselves, together.
Best Mistakes Podcast brings you an evening each month for queer night life to restore, rejuvenate, and relate!
Standup comedy hosted by Nika Lomazzo and Anya Volz, taking the time to commiserate about and celebrate our mistakes, life lessons, and growth. Lineup TBA!
Followed by social hour
"Get Real"
-- a fun way to have deep conversations with people you've never met. Utilizing a psychology-based format and thought-provoking prompts, it's a great way to make new friends with no stress!  Hosted by Lincoln.
The vibe of the night is all about putting energy and effort into the human beings that surround us on the dance floor each weekend, or on the train to work each weekday. Investing in the strangers and friends around us, that, when woven together, create the beautiful tapestry of the NYC queer community-- and to carry with us that care and support from this event to the rest of our lives!  Bring your besties to and leave with even more besties!
