In a two-room tour, the exhibition explores the economic index Country Risk from a particular perspective: the Argentine socio-cultural context in which the works are produced and the effect these conditions have on the collective imagination. Each piece presented deals with different themes related to this starting point, including sustained precariousness and the various narratives that emerge from an environment in constant crisis.

About CryptoArg:
CryptoArg is an Argentinian collective and ethereal network that promotes the creation, cooperation, and exchange of knowledge between artists. We seek to link the abstract power of the cryptoart world with the materiality of the physical circuits inhabited by the affective, sanguine, carnal, and desiring bodies that form the community. As a geolocalized community, we focus on the articulation of regional creative potential.
