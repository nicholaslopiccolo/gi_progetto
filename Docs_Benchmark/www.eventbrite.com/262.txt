FREE ROLLER SKATING IN THE PARK. Tickets, Sat, Jun 25, 2022 at 3:00 PM | Eventbrite
Sat, June 25, 2022, 3:00 PM – 7:00 PM EDT

Come join us every Saturday for a fun filled day of roller skating in the park. This event is for beginners, intermediate and advance skaters. All are welcome to join us. If you have never skated before and you’d like to learn, we have a FREE 1hr beginner’s class starting April 23, 2022 @ 3Pm – 4Pm. Please RSVP if you’d like to take advantage of the FREE class.
Roller skates are NOT provided you must bring your own skates. If you have never skated before or you are a beginner, we recommend getting elbow, knees and wrist grads. If you can only do one, we highly recommend wrist grad. Your hands/wrist is the first thing you use to break your fall hence it’s always the first part of your body to get hurt.
Roller Skating is not only fun, It’s also a great workout for everyone. So come out and join us and lets have a fun filled day of roller skating in the Park.
Please remember to RSVP for the class and to attend the event.
