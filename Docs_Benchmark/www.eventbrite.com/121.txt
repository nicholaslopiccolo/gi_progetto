HAPPY PRIDE 🌈🌈🌈!!
Since 2010 our dance floors have been a sacred space for Black, queer, and trans folks to be in community with each other.
Join us Saturday June 25th from 10pm - 3am at @bellhouseny in Brooklyn.
We’ve got @_elosi @cieradunbar & @thecanteenkilla spinning all night, so be ready to dance! We’ll have delicious food from @kitankin (dropping the menu soon).
COVID GUIDELINES: Vaccination or Negative test required.
The venue is wheelchair accessible, and we will have special seating for folks who need them. Feel free to email us if you have special needs or requirements that we may accommodate in the space, or if you don't have the financial means to purchase a ticket. Contact:  info@bklynboihood.com.
