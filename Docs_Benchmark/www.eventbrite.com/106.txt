About The Film
Steve Jackson and Wardell Franklin sneak out of their houses to visit Madame Zenobia's: a high-class but illegal nightclub. During their visit, however, the place is robbed and they are forced to hand over their wallets. Steve's wallet turns out to have contained a winning lottery ticket, and together they must recover their stolen property
The Garden opens at 7pm and the movie begins at sundown. Arrive early to snag the best seats and enjoy some pre-screening activities.
