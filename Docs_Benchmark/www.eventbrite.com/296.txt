Are you interested in NFTS? Do you want to know more about this new form of crypto? Are you tired of twitter spaces and zoom calls and want to meet and mingle with fellow crypto/NFT enthusiasts in person? Well we got a fun event for you!  Join me (popular NYC comedian) Todd Montesi as I start up a new weekly mixer showcasing the vibrant NFT community in the heart of hip Soho at Adoro Lei! We’ll be interviewing & featuring up and coming artists, projects, creators and tech specialists/innovators in the space as well as have NFT giveaways throughout the evening. We also have a dope free comedy show immediately afterwards!  Wednesdays starting March 23rd at 7PM, come by and hang out with us!
