Hell's Kitchen NFT Gallery is the premier location for emerging artists to showcase their amazing talents and launch into the fine art NFT community.
We provide a unique experience and venue that brings together the physical and the digital, the distinguished gallery and the old fashioned speakeasy.
Our current exhibit proudly showcases LGBTQ artists and we are proud to celebrate NYC Pride 2022 with them! In honor of this no cover will be charged all weekend. Come for the fun, have a drink and celebrate with friends and immerse yourself into the art experience.
