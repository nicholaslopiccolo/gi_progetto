NYC PrideFest 2022
WELCOME BACK!
Going into it's 28th year, PrideFest is thrilled to be BACK for our annual LGBTQIA+ street fair that combines exhibitors, entertainers, food and activities for a day of fun and celebration in the name of equality. PrideFest brings together NYC locals, families, sponsors, community leaders and area business owners
PrideFest is the perfect place to stop and listen to a few tunes, grab a bite to eat or score some great Pride gear. And the best part is, it's totally FREE!
Teeming with unique vendors that will make you swell with pride, this event is not to be missed! And we're ready to implement protocols that not only keep PrideFest a space for all, but also a safe space in the midst of Covid-19.
