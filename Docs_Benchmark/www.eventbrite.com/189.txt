Welcome to the Jersey City Americana Music Festival. There will be 2 stages of live music. An outdoor stage featuring regional and local acts, as well as an indoor stage between sets. The music never stops. There will be music inside and out, and never overlapping. Enjoy sets from local bands such as Steel Press, Viktor.Digital and Widely Grown, as well as the regional acts, Sean Tobin and Jackson Pines. Between sets wander the grounds with vendors and food trucks or head inside to catch special sets at the Singer-Songwriter Stage. The evening will finish off with a Grateful Dead Jamboree featuring a multitude of musicians from the day. Unrehearsed, in the true spirit of the Dead.
902 will be pouring the beers.
