bio:
Gabrielle Revlock is a choreographer, performer, improviser, somatics educator and creator of Restorative Contact, a mindful touch-based movement practice, in-part inspired by her 20+ years as a practitioner of CI. In her choreographic work she depicts complicated but relatable interpersonal relationships, developed through meticulous character study and improvisational structures. For these she has been honored with a Bessie Award, Rocky Award and was a finalist at The Award Show: Philadelphia. In 2019 she was a Target Margin Institute Fellow and in 2018 she was named  ‘Newcomer of the Year’ by the performance journal Tanz. Revlock was a presenter at the 2020 Embodiment Conference, 2020 Dance & Somatics Conference and 2021 Future of CI Conference. For 2022 she will be an invited facilitator at the 50th Anniversary of Contact Improvisation as well as a contributor to a book of essays on the subject edited by Ann Cooper Albright.
