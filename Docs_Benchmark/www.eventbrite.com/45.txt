Are there ID requirements or an age limit to enter the event?
Rooftop Films are open to all ages, but ID and proof of age is required for entry. You must be 21+ to attend the after party.
Can I bring food and drinks?
No outside alcoholic beverages are allowed. Feel free to bring snacks and non-alcoholic beverages! No glass on the roof, please!
Can I wear heels?
Sorry, but not on the roof we ask that you don't wear stiletto heels as it's a soft roof. You are allowed to wear pointy heels in the Courtyard and we provide flip flops if needed.
Do I need to wear a mask?
All attendees are required to wear a mask during check in, and while indoors. Masks are encouraged while interacting with staff outdoors. Mask policy may be updated based on current local conditions at the time of the event. Ticket holders will be notified of policy changes via email prior to the event.
How accessible is this venue?
There will be a few flights of stairs to climb up to the roof. If you would like to attend this event but have an ADA need, we can provide a freight elevator. There is one step that will be unavoidable in stepping onto the roof. Our courtyard seating (available at select events) is entirely accessible. If this brings up any concerns, please email us at tickets@rooftopfilms.com or call at 718-417-7362 for more information.
