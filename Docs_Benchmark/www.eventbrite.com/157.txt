[END OF UPDATE]
We will be hosting a Tech Career Fair for hiring companies from fast growing startups to Fortune 500 companies in technology. There will be a focus on helping companies achieve their diversity and inclusivity initiative with more diverse candidates from non-traditional backgrounds (bootcamps/self-taught/non-degree/veterans etc) or experienced professionals who are transitioning careers to their talent pool. With over thousands of candidates already signed up, our partners from
CareersCrossroad
will help implement a system to help facilitate narrowing down the right candidates. Companies will also be able to easily add candidates into their pipeline with the recommended diversity candidates identified from the algorithm .
Roles that our diverse candidates are looking for are of the following:
Software Engineering
Product Management
Data Scientist
AI/Machine Learning Engineer
Data Analyst
UI/UX Design
