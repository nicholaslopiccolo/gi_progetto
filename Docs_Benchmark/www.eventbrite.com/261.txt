Blockchain 101 Workshop Tickets, Multiple Dates | Eventbrite
--no date--

Welcome to Blockchain 101
During this workshop you will learn the history of blockchain technology, what are NFTs, What are crypto currencies, and how to build your own universes using the technology.
The workshop will be activity based so you won't just be watching long boring 2 hour long power point presentations. You will be getting hands on with the technology and learning how to use the technology by yourself using just your phone.
Come and get prepared for what will be soon be the future for only $15 a session.
You could also get free access to all the classes by owning one of our limited Blockchain 101 NFTs. Owning the NFT will give you free access to the course as long as you own the NFT. You can purchase them on Opensea.io or the Nu Africa Marketplace.
