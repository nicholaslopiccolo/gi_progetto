Let's Talk... Conversations on Race, Equity, & Belonging Tickets, Thu, Jul 21, 2022 at 5:00 PM | Eventbrite
Thu, July 21, 2022, 5:00 PM – 6:30 PM EDT

If you have no idea what this is… this conversation is for you…
If you “feel some kind of way” when you hear CRT…this conversation is for you
If you have heard about it, but not really sure what it is…this conversation is for you.
If you know all about it…don’t come…(JUST KIDDING)…this conversation is for you.
Basically this conversation is for everyone to be learn, understand, and be open to concepts you might have judged without really knowing anything about it.
Even if you can't make it, register anyway, we will send you the recording.
We look forward to seeing you there!!
