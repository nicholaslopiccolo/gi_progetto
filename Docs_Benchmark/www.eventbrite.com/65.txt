Thu, June 30, 2022, 6:00 PM – 8:00 PM EDT

Join 1000heads in person for the first of our new panel series on web3. Each event will focus on a different area of web3 and give brand marketers actionable insights into how they can harness the technology in meaningful ways.
The first panel will focus on real-world applications of NFTs. We will be joined by the creator of Smart Seal Mark Shakleton, NFT consultant Mike Adler and 1000heads web3 expert Michael Zimmerman, to discuss best practices for creating NFT programs and applications. We’ll explore how they can be used for authenticating goods, rewarding loyalty, creating community, and more.
This panel will be held in our office, with drinks and nibbles after, and live-streamed, accessible here: meet.google.com/mxa-trhz-zon.
Later events will be happening in July and August.
