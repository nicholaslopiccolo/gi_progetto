Fun With Friends Block Party Tickets, Sat, Jul 2, 2022 at 3:00 PM | Eventbrite
Sat, July 2, 2022, 3:00 PM – 10:00 PM EDT

Let’s do it again! Let’s bring back those classic Brooklyn summertime vibes as we take over 99 Scott and transform it into “our block.”
Snag your tickets early, and meet us on the block! From double Dutch to ducking and dodging in a water gun fight, we’re capturing the essence of carefree Brooklyn block party energy.
As you take part in the FUN, we’ll be serving up food, drink specials, and sounds from some of our FRIEND favorite DJs.
To ensure the block stays hot, we’ll have our masters of ceremonies Goldie, Craig James & Prophet Goose working the crowd. Keeping the energy all the way up.
Let’s all be FRIENDS  and bring the FUN back to the block!
Rain or shine the FUN goes on.
