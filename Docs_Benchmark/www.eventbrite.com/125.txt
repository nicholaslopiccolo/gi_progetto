4th Annual #UnitedGreekPride Tickets, Sun, Jun 26, 2022 at 12:00 PM | Eventbrite
Sun, June 26, 2022, 12:00 PM – 5:00 PM EDT

Organized in 2017, #UnitedGreekPride models after the success of Sororities of color such as @MuSigmaUpsilon, @OmegaPhiBeta, and @Slu1987 who have been consistently participating in the #NYCPrideMarch for years prior.
#UnitedGreekPride is a collaborative effort that unites different Greek lettered councils such as #NALFO, #NMGC, and #NPHC to name a few.
In 2016, Pulse Nightclub’s tragedy left an indelible mark on our community. Ready to mobilize, the goal was to not only empower but help heal our  members in fraternities and sororities, especially those of color.
Co-lead by @LUL.Out and @MSU_D4, our participation yields over 525 registrants across 25+ national Greek Organizations. We are extremely humbled by our communities response and hope to continue growing our tribe for years to come!
