Seinfeld Trivia Tickets, Sun, Jun 26, 2022 at 3:00 PM | Eventbrite
Sun, June 26, 2022, 3:00 PM â€“ 9:30 PM EDT

Well, there's nothin' more sophisticated than diddlin' the maid and then playing Seinfeld Trivia at Texas Arizona on Sunday, June 26 at 3pm!
Use your katra to dominate the dojo during all FIVE unique and challenging rounds on cockfighting, mail fraud, headfirst parking and pee-stained couches.
For reservations visit; https://Seinfeld062622.Eventbrite.com
The best way to reserve tickets is by selecting a team captain and having them be in charge of tickets for ALL team members.
For example, if Jerry, George, Kramer and Elaine are a team and Elaine gets put in charge, she will then reserve tickets for herself, Jerry, George and Kramer = (4) in total.
PLEASE ONLY RESERVE SINGLE TICKETS IF YOU ARE PLAYING BY YOURSELF.
We will send a confirmation email to everyone closer to the event.
