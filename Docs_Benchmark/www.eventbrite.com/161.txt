Born in India and hailing from a musically diverse family, Raun is a prolific session player with perfect pitch, whose main musical domain was blues, rock, folk/bluegrass and rockabilly. His solo performances in the most acclaimed venues and productions, attested and separate him from his compatriots. He could also play some mean and dexterous bop-influenced jazz guitar. At the root of his sound is a deep blues core, which manifests itself in a plaintive crying tone that affect the whole industry. For many years, his signature style – which was loud and funky also uses rock-style amp feedback and highly stylized soundscapes.
