No Artist Info Open Mic Tickets, Multiple Dates | Eventbrite
--no date--

THIS IS NOT THE SIGNUP SHEET. THIS IS ONLY FOR RSVP TO THE EVENT ITSELF. You can use eventbrite to send you a calendar invite in case that is helpful.
The Open Mic by No Artist Info, a platform and community for artists by artists, goes up every Monday 6:30pm-12am at Starr Bar (214 Starr Street, Brooklyn). Part variety show, part jam session and part cypher, the Open Mic epitomizes what No Artist Info is all about: providing a safe space for creative expression and an oasis for artists to build with one another and enhance their respective crafts. There’s no charge to sign up and performers receive a complimentary drink ticket to boot.
The Open Mic also aims to provide opportunities for growth and expansion: performers have the chance to be tapped to rock full sets at No Artist Info’s monthly showcases, as well as receive the platform’s database of independent artist resources, which lists other open mics around NYC, affordable recording studios and more.
Hosted by Que Cee, No Artist Info’s Open Mic takes inspiration from the spirit of classic, legendary open mic and jam session platforms Freestyle Mondays, The Lesson and more. Come through to communicate, share and vibe together.
