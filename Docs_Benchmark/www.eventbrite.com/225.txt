Our Wonderland Brunch is a special event that takes place at 11am every Sunday. Here at Madd Hatter, we want you to sit down and enjoy your late morning with an exceptional meal. We are a notorious sports bar, located in Hoboken, New Jersey. We let the good times roll, and we would love to let you enjoy an easy-going meal to start your day. Book your table in advance to secure your Wonderland Brunch. Don’t worry about a thing when you take a seat at our table. We have everything covered from the food to the music. If you can’t make it this Sunday, just come next Sunday!  We Love The High Energy Brunch!!!
On top of your delicious meal, enjoy some good music to get your day going. Every Sunday, we host a different DJ to start off your week the right way. This Sunday on April 12th, celebrate DJ Encore’s big birthday bash. He loves to party, and you love to party; it’s a match made in heaven. Our best drinks include the Mojito Pitcher, the Pink Party Rose, and the Wonderland Punch. Enjoy a carefree Sunday by starting your week off with a nice buzz. By the time you head out, you’ll feel refreshed and ready to get back to work. Wake up late, and take a Sunday drive to our spot. Our bar is located on 221 Washington Street in Hoboken, New Jersey.
