COMEDIANS YOU SHOULD KNOW is a stand-up comedy collective for some of the funniest up-and-coming stand-up comedians in the country. Since its inception in 2008, CYSK has produced a weekly stand-up comedy showcase in downtown Chicago that continues to draw sold-out crowds and a loyal local following. Fans and comedians alike recognize CYSK for it's unwavering commitment to presenting only the very funniest local comedians and visiting guests. The Onion AV Club writes of CYSK, "the genuine level of talent is unrivaled in Chicago."
In 2017, CYSK branched out east, bringing the same scrappy, comedic vision and DIY-attitude to New York City, home of the best stand-up comedians in the world. With the venue re-opening, we are thrilled to be back. In a dynamic comedy scene with so many different styles of comedy shows, CYSK believe the only gimmick required is presenting the very funniest standup comics available; the only theme to the show is that all of the performers are comedians you really should know.
