Meditation and Emotional Wellness Support Group, Mon, Jul 11, 2022, 7:30 PM   | Meetup
--no date--

DetailsJoin us to enhance your applied meditation practice and share lived experiences while finding support in a safe space. This group meets twice a month on Mondays at 7:30 PM (2nd and 4th Mondays).
We will have a hybrid format, so participants can attend either in-person at the Philadelphia Meditation Center (PMC) in Havertown, PA or via Zoom based on their personal preference. We'll begin with a 10-20 minute sitting meditation, then transition to a discussion/support group for 40-60 minutes.
Participants can share challenges they've experienced, offer advice, and discuss application of mindfulness strategies, incorporating practical guidance from the early Buddhist texts (suttas). Please feel free to share this invite with others you think may be interested in joining in person.
Please register using Eventbrite (free) after which we will send you the Zoom link the day before the event (this helps us track attendance accurately): https://www.eventbrite.com/e/meditation-and-emotional-wellness-support-group-tickets-305109138647Positive MeditationSee more events
