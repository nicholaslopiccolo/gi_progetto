HOW IT WORKS:
This completely online event will be LIVE and you will be able to see and hear the other participants while playing. In addition you get to meet and interact with other participants.
At game time, your host will read off the Trivia questions. Your goal is to come up with the right answer to each question and write it down on your paper. Once the round is over (about 6 questions), we will go through the answers and determine who had the highest score for the round. They will get a raffle ticket for a chance to win a prize at the end of the event.
We will have multiple rounds of play and have a system to also virtually introduce you to other participants.
HOW TO JOIN:
After you purchase your ticket, you will get a Zoom link emailed to you THE DAY OF THE EVENT.
RSVPS ON HERE ARE NOT REFLECTIVE OF ACTUAL ATTENDANCE as this is a multi-group event and we've already received a good # of sign ups.
