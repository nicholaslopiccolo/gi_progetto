Meditation and Emotional Wellness Support Group, Mon, Jun 27, 2022, 7:30 PM   | Meetup
--no date--

DetailsJoin us to enhance your applied meditation practice and share lived experiences while finding support in a safe space. This free group meets twice a month on Mondays at 7:30 PM (2nd and 4th Mondays).
We will have a hybrid format, so participants can attend either in-person at the Philadelphia Meditation Center (PMC) in Havertown, PA or via Zoom based on their personal preference. We'll begin with a 10-20 minute sitting meditation, then transition to a discussion/support group for 40-60 minutes.
Participants can share challenges they've experienced, offer advice, and discuss application of mindfulness strategies, incorporating practical guidance from the early Buddhist texts (suttas). Please feel free to share this invite with others you think may be interested in joining in person.
Please register using this Google form (the event is free); this will help us track attendance (we will send you the Zoom link the day before the event): https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfPUiwnGgu8VJ2rkseS6Q80nPoqi4dJfBwvEBL4s5wjDZUdPg/viewformPositive MeditationSee more events
