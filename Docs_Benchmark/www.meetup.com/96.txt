Startup Idea Pitch Practice: Get Friendly Feedback from Experts, online, Tue, Jun 28, 2022, 1:00 PM   | Meetup
--no date--

DetailsTo launch a great startup, it is absolutely critical to get friendly feedback on your ideas and pitch from entrepreneurs that have been there, and done that. On this interactive online event, you can learn the best practices for pitching and sharing your startup ideas, and then join several video chats to get feedback in an open and helpful environment. These chats will be hosted by entrepreneurs, advisors, and investors with vast experience in launching and building fast-growing companies. Even if you don't want to share, you can join to hear startup ideas, learn from the experts, and meet other idea-stage entrepreneurs.
