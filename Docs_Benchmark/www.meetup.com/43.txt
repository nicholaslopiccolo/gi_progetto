Shut Up & Write [AT HOME], Mon, Jul 11, 2022, 10:00 AM   | Meetup
--no date--

DetailsWe got together to write, simple as that. No pressure to share your work or read anybody else's, no assignments or challenges. We just show up to hold each other accountable and build a sense of community.
10 minutes of introductions, then mute your mics and 50 minutes of writing (hence, Shut Up and Write!), 10 minutes of chatting, 50 minutes of writing. And you can start your day right knowing that you wrote :)
