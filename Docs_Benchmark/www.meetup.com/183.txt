About Open Coffee Club
Founders, investors, technologists, students, professors, designers, and everyone in between are welcome to join us for Open Coffee Club.
Open Coffee Club is a relaxed atmosphere for networking, discussing ideas, and making connections. It is free and open for everyone.
Open Coffee Club is an open-concept idea started by Saul Klein, one of the cofounders of Skype and a London based Venture Capitalist. Made to be replicated around the world, Open Coffee Club is designed to facilitate low-pressure interactions between startups and the broader innovation ecosystem. We are proud to host the first Open Coffee Club in the Newark Area.
*** We require all attendees to provide proof of vaccination. ***Brick City TechSee more events
