Women in their Twenties and Thirties is a social discussion group for queer women in the Washington, D.C. area. We meet on the 2nd and 4th Fridays of each month on Zoom. All are welcome to join us. WiTT is a great way to make new friends and meet other queer women in a fun and friendly setting.
Beyond our regular meetings, WiTT is also involved in the LGBTQ community of Washington, D.C. in varying ways. We create a variety of opportunities to meet and mingle with other queer women in the area. Some of our events include happy hours, picnics (WiTTnics), and going out to queer dance parties.
Our events provide a wide range of occasions for making new friends, having new experiences, and just getting out around the city with other great queer women. In the past, we have planned group trips and visits to various museums, and we always welcome people to plan new events.
