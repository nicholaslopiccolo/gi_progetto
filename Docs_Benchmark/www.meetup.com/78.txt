Blockchain data visualization, Thu, Jun 30, 2022, 6:00 PM   | Meetup
--no date--

DetailsThis week we will dive into Arbitrum's data. Arbitrum is a layer 2 Blockchain that is working on top of Ethereum. While these Layer 2 projects benefit from the security of ethereum, they allow for higher transaction through put.
It's better to have prior knowledge about them before you participate. But If you don't its ok, we will take some time in the break out room to talk about it.
We are fetching data from this link:

most specifically, we will be digging in the Arbitrum data which is coming soon to Flipside data base.
So, you save time if you sign up before hand.
