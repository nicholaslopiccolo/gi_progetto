Meatless Monday -- 4th of July Celebration, Mon, Jul 4, 2022, 6:00 PM   | Meetup
--no date--

DetailsThe first Monday falls on the 4th of July so it is time to celebrate and re-imagine the cook-out with grilled portobello mushrooms instead of burgers or a red, white and blueberry kale salad.
July Food for Thought: One reason I am trying to eat lower on the food chain is to spread the grain we have further, given the shortages causes by the war in the Ukraine. If you want to help local food-insecure families, the Food Bank is a great organization: https://foodbankcenc.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Hunger-Matters_Summer2022.pdf
Real Food for July: I have become a fan of protein-rich sides such as Mediterranean lentil salad and a chickpea-cucumber chiller (1 cucumber, 1 can of garbanzo beans, olives, garlic, maybe tomatoes, purple onions, and your favorite Mediterranean vinaigrette).
The treasure this month is lettuce wraps -- no added heat in your kitchen and all those summer vegetables you can experiment with: https://www.seedsnc.org/2020/07/summer-lettuce-wraps/

We hope we can eventually get together to share food, but for now, we are feasting separately and then sharing pictures and recipes.NC Sierra Club--Headwaters GroupSee more events
