GROUP TRANSCENDATION: Make Your Intentions Reality!, Sun, Jul 3, 2022, 1:00 PM   | Meetup
--no date--

DetailsTranscendation begins with intention--the reason/motivation for our desire to transcend. There is an undeniable power in stating our intentions aloud, in a safe, supportive environment. After our intentions are shared (and possibly clarified), we begin exploring. This can be at times exhilarating, terrifying, enthralling, monotonous, neutral, repetitive, glorious, and frequently: all of the above.
Transcendation is a synthesis of many transformational practices and methods, in addition to being a uniquely and divinely revealed modality.
TRANSCENDATION = “Transcending” (to rise above or go beyond; exceed; pass beyond), + “Celebration” (to perform a religious ceremony; to participate in an uninhibited good time), a profound opportunity for life-changing spiritual work. We progress through personal blocks in a group setting, uncovering hidden self-knowledge and gaining true clarity.
OPTIONAL: You can send your intention in writing to info@SoulsEnterprise.org to begin the magic before the day of the event!
