The Pursuit of Happiness (and why people are full of shit), Tue, Jun 28, 2022, 7:00 PM   | Meetup
--no date--

DetailsI'm gonna write a better description, but for now you get this:
People pretend to be happy all the time and it can make you feel like you're not happy enough. Those people are full of shit and you're fine.
This month we're gonna talk about happiness and how it's unhealthy to "bE hApPy" all day every day. That's right I'm gonna shit talk happiness.
Come see a show. See you there!Heart UniversitySee more events
