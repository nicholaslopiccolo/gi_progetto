Get guidance from Jessica Shotwell Walker of Momentum Transformations, LLC in Peachtree City, GA, who has certifications as both an Integrative Nutrition Health Coach and a Level 1 Precision Nutrition Coach with over 18 years of personal experience. Jessica has reversed her Type 2 Diabetes and PCOS, has dropped and kept off 65 extra pounds, and has been prescription-free since 2007!
Jessica firmly advocates that, in the long-term, when people use pills, powders, potions, and pre-packaged food for their weight loss efforts, the only thing that gets slimmer is their bank accounts. Instead, Jessica helps her clients learn how to plan for, shop for, and cook Real Food that supports their own long-term fat-loss and wellness goals with a habit-based, and accountability-centered program that includes plenty of personal one-to-one coaching support.Southern Crescent Keto / Low Carb SupportSee more events
