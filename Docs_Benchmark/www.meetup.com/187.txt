Hi everyone! We hope you have been staying healthy, safe, and warm this winter season! We are so excited to share that our Interfaithless meetup will be returning this month! Join us every last Monday of the month from 6:30-8:00pm EST on Zoom, to connect with other folks who have left insular religious communities to discuss topics like relationships with family and friends, mental health, and lots more. You donâ€™t have to have attended previously to join this one! Everyone is welcome :)
-Chana & Sarah
