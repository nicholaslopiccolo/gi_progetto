CryptoProCafe’s Intro to CryptoCurrency: The ultimate beginners guide, Wed, Jun 29, 2022, 6:00 PM   | Meetup
--no date--

DetailsIt’s the Wild West out there! This is a free step-by-step course for beginners who are just getting started and want to build a solid foundation, instructor-led by Alisa C., founder of CryptoProCafe. You’ll learn what a blockchain really is, the difference between coins and tokens, how the space has evolved and why there are so many scams and how to avoid the most obvious ones. We’ll also look at a list of “what to look for” in a project with the URLs of the the most common places to look. All attendees will get a copy of “What Jonathon Watches,” our list of top YouTube videos that our top trader uses to keep up! You’ll leave with a better understanding and ability to assess your own investment strategy and risk tolerance level.
