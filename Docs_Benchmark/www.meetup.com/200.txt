DetailsEntrepreneurs Happy Hour at Selina
Attend if....

You're a founder, want to be one, or love helping them.
You like meeting, learning from and brainstorming with entrepreneurs
Just want to get out of your apartment!

After a crazy day of startup life, let's meet up, compare stories and chat with fellow founders over a drink, (and if the weather's good, head outside to their terrace or roof).
Even more exciting, Selina the very cool travel and coworking lifestyle brand are hosting us, and have developed a special happy hour menu just for our group.

Selected beer $5 and wine / nibbles $8.
After the happy hour ends at 7pm, stay longer and get 15% off other drinks.

Sign up ASAP.
If your name isnt on the list, you'll be outside, peering in forlornly 😢
ps - Selina also welcomes people to come and work during the day, so if you want to arrive earlier feel free to bring your laptop.COVID-19 safety measuresCOVID-19 vaccination requiredEvent will be indoorsWho knows what the Covid situation will be 🤷‍♀️, so come prepared with vaccintaion certificate and a mask.The event host is instituting the above safety measures for this event.
