Reshma is a money wisdom coach and an author who has made it her mission to help professional women confidently organize their finances with simple visual tools; so that they never again live paycheck to paycheck, go into debt, or feel broke, as they consistently achieve their financial goals and ultimately become financially free.
She embarked on her journey to becoming an entrepreneur in 2018, soon after ending her abusive marriage of 12 years. Her new journey was exciting, even though it came with growing pains.
By being financially savvy, she made sound decisions that left her with optionsâ€”including having an emergency fund! Through life experiences and all the mistakes she made over the years, Reshma has gained enough wisdom and strategies to pass along this knowledge to other women.
During these 40-minute inspirational sessions, we will be talking about impactful topics such as:

Financial Freedom for peace and joy
The importance of awareness
Root chakra for money mindset and stability
Materialism and Minimalism lifestyle
Increased self-worth being a superpower
The power of financial literacy

Letâ€™s empower each other!
