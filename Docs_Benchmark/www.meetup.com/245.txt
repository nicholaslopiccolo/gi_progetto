--no date--

Detailsâœ¨GIRL GANG YOGAâœ¨
Every Thursday at 6 in Central Park. We will move our way through asanas, moving our way through the ebbs and flows of life, and then have a picnic to connect.
To embrace the true meaning of sisterhood is remembering to become the sister that we want to have in our lives. 90% of yoga practitioners are female, so letâ€™s gather and practice together. Part of the strength that develops from practicing with your sisters in yoga is that there is an unspoken agreement to hold a safe space for each other.
With all the pressures in our daily lives, it's tremendously important for women to be supportive of other women without competing with each other. Developing a positive dialogue with other women helps us develop a positive inner dialog with ourselves.
ðŸ’• energy exchange is $20 paid via Venmo or cash on arrival.
ðŸ’• please bring a mat, some water & a snack to share with your sisters when weâ€™re done.COVID-19 safety measuresEvent will be outdoorThe event host is instituting the above safety measures for this event.
