ONLINE Meet and Greet- Open Pagan discussion, Sun, Jun 26, 2022, 9:00 AM   | Meetup
--no date--

DetailsZoom sets this to 40 minutes, not an hour.
This is the first MWW/ CNCP "network event" geared a bit for those who were looking for online Pagan discussions :)
This is a bit of an open Pagan chat on Zoom
(you get the link when you RSVP).
My goal of these chats to to open the floor for discussions in a safe and friendly manner.
(I find them to be great ice breakers and awesome ways to meet new people as well as a nice way to see friends in the metaphysical space on a regular basis- I love them!)
I try to have 4 chats each weekend (sometimes I am able to do all four, sometimes I have to shift the schedule a bit- this weekend is a schedule shift since I am at Rockhill Pride on 6/25)
Regular zoom chats are scheduled as such:
Saturday at 9 am- "Tarot Talk"
Saturday at 10- "Witchy Chat"
Sunday at 9 am- "Tarot Talk"
Sunday at 10 am- "Witchy Chat"Charlotte NC PagansSee more events
