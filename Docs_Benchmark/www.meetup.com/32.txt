DetailsPersepolis used to be one of the capitals of Achamenid dynasty dating back to 2500 years ago. One upon a time, being the capital of the strongest empire in the world. Persepolis used to be a secret from the outside world, and it became the safest city in the Persian Empire for storing art, artifacts, archives, and keeping the royal treasury. The Greeks had no idea the city existed until it was sacked and plundered by Alexander the Great (l. 356-323 BCE) in 330 BCE, who burned it and carried off its vast treasures.
