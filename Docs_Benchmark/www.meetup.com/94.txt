If you can use a little support right now, feel free to join this virtual group. I'll be leading an informal meetup, offering some techniques to help you feel more empowered in your life, refreshed, calmer, more in control of your well-being.
We'll work with techniques based on the needs of the group, and that can include areas like light meditation, visualization, connecting with your intuition, calming energy techniques, acupressure, and good old fashioned fun :) among others.A Little Support Right Now Virtual Meetup GroupSee more events
