Moving Forward with Your Vision, Mon, Jul 11, 2022, 7:00 PM   | Meetup
--no date--

DetailsThis is a coaching circle to get supported around your personal and professional goals. All people are welcome. Whether your project is in the idea stage, the launching stage, or you are going through a rebranding, this group will support you! Personal projects involving relationships, health and wellness, and creativity also included. All of it is related when we look from the bird's eye view. Expect to receive greater levels of awareness, create breakthroughs around your resistance, and receive accountability and support on how to add speed to your success.
What to Expect: We will set the container to ensure confidentiality and a short explanation of what coaching is/is not to make the most of our time. Short introductions from each individual, sharing as detailed or broad as you'd like what projects or goals you are looking to move forward with, and what you would like to walk away with from the discussion. We will then move into deep conversation around our limitations and where we find ourselves getting stuck. I will ask open-ended, thought-provoking questions to the individual and group to assist in breakthroughs and new levels of awareness.Naperville Lifestyle Transformation MeetupSee more events
