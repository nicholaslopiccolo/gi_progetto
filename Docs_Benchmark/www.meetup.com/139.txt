The New York City Brights Meetup Group Monthly Meetup, Talking Brightly., Sun, Jul 3, 2022, 1:00 PM   | Meetup
--no date--

DetailsDear Brights,
Our notoriously pandemic postponed Museum of Natural History Monthly First Sunday Walk and Talk is still postponed but...
We will be meeting online with Zoom on every first Sunday until further notice for...
Talking Brightly with Charlie
It will be recurring from 1pm to 3pm every first Sunday of the month.
Initially, it will be an open discussion about current topics of interest related to things under our shared naturalistic worldview umbrella of The Brights, for like-minded individuals. The first Talking Brightly will be a pandemic "catch-up" for regular members of my Meetups. The Brights, Allied Non-Believers United-The Reality Union, Guardians Against The Tyranny Of Fanaticism, and The New York First Church of The Flying Spaghetti Monster Meetup.
(Please note: Trolls and other antagonists will be dealt with as needed. TBA. The recording will be announced as needed but this is initially a private non-recorded exchange for discussion not debate.)
It may follow that special guests or specific topics will be addressed. Those who are familiar with our intentions and style (collegial and relevant to those under our umbrella- see The-Brights.net) it is a place for camaraderie and encouragement and reality-based considerations of science, culture, art, education, politics and other human phenomena. Etc.
Our regular, live Walk and Talk Meetup will resume asap. as safety and circumstances allow, TBD. TBA. Other special events, programs. and announcements to follow.
Charles Zorn is inviting you to a scheduled Zoom meeting.
