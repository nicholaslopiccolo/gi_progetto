DetailsWhere women come together in possibility.

This month we are going to cover ideas for no-cost ways to:

- flip the switch from overwhelm to find joy and ease in your everyday.
Bring a notebook and pen, your fav patio drink, a small crunchy snack and your willingness to engage and share with others. See you then!
