Welcome to The Harmony Collective!
NOTE: This is a meeting for womxn only. You may be asked to open your video to ensure that you are a womxn so others may feel comfortable with who is present at the meeting.
Are you looking for a community of womxn who “get you”? Womxn who love personal development and growth just like you? How about others who strive to live their best selves each day?
Come join us for an evening of Growth Conversations, hosted in a safe space where you can feel supported and inspired with a community committed to improving their lives.
We will start off each meeting with time to network and introduce ourselves. Each meeting we will do a deep dive into a personal development topic and discuss it together. We’ll have the opportunity to share, dig deeper and learn from each other.
Bring a notebook and an open heart and mind and join us for a night of growth – together.
Please RSVP so we know you’ll be there.
