Evolve Women's Network: Women of Color Empowerment, Tue, Jul 5, 2022, 9:00 AM   | Meetup
--no date--

DetailsEvolve exists to provide a welcoming place for professional women to create an authentic community, deeper connections, and confident growth through networking and workshop events. No cliques, no judgement. At Evolve we believe in encouraging EVERY woman in business! We saw a need for more women of color in leadership roles...more need for women of color to have a voice and to be honored and heard. The leadership team and speakers of our Empowerment Panel will be made up of women of color.
We welcome ALL women to join the conversation! This is an open forum for challenges we're all facing and we're here to support and serve one another. Join us to hear from expert panelists on important topics related to creating, sustaining, and growing a business. This meeting is for all women in business who want to hear from women who've been where they're going!
