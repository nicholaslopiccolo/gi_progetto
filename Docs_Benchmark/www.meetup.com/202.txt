EVENT OBJECTIVE:

Help Realtors & wholesalers meet a buyer for their deal.
Help investors find their next deal.
For newbies learn how to do due diligence on deals like a pro
If you got a deal but don't know if its a deal... or just simply need some coaching on a deal this is event not to miss

OUR PROCESS:
At this event we invite Realtors & wholesalers to pitch their deal. In the pitch we want to know everything there is to know about the deal. From there we will invite potential investors & cash buyers in the room to ask their questions. After we will invite the panel of experts to ask their questions. We are in essence doing due diligence on the deal together as a group.
If the deal make sense we invite anyone that is interested in the deal the deal to make an offer. If the deal doesn't make sense we will work together to make it into a deal. As long as you got an open mind, you cannot fail to meet a buyer for your deal!
