WEBINAR: Ahead of Product Co-Founder & Coach on Scalable Leadership Frameworks
Navigating the Product Management journey can be a very frustrating experience. Many of us get stuck in the shoes of a Sr. Product Manager longer than necessary, while only a handful of us get a lucky ticket to leadership by chance or design. So, how do we ensure we are on the path to leadership? Ahead of Product co-founder and coach, Katerina Suchkova, shares insights on scalable leadership frameworks to start thinking like a leader.
About The Speaker: Katerina works with individual clients looking to level up their careers and craft as product managers and leaders. She partners with product organizations that are looking to create a scalable career ladder and PM competencies framework, establish successful remote hiring practices and build a strong team in a hybrid working environment.
