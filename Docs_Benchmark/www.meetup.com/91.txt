Women of Culture Intro: Night of Discovery & Connection, Mon, Jul 11, 2022, 6:00 PM   | Meetup
--no date--

DetailsJoin us for a free online networking event to connect with fellow Women of Culture members and learn more about the community.
Advance registration is required here.
Whether you are new to the community or have been a long-time member, this is a great way to de-stress after work and connect with fellow art-full women in a fun and relaxed online networking session.
Especially if you have been curious about Women of Culture but want to learn more or meet other members before joining an IRL event, this is a great way to get a feeling of what the community is all about.
Bring your favorite beverage or snack and come with an open heart & mind - ready to mingle, ask questions and unwind from the workday with female friends, old and new. This will be an INTERACTIVE call, so please try to attend from a quiet place where you are able to participate. Cameras on, if possible!
Plus, you will receive a code for 10% off your first Women of Culture event, and free trial month of the Art-full membership just for having joined the call :)
This is a FREE event, but you must register here in order to receive the zoom link and discount offers.
We can't wait to 'see' you there!
Advance registration is required here.
Each month's call will have a slightly different theme, relating to the art around that theme, in order to keep it interesting for returning attendees, too :)
