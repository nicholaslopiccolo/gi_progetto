--no date--

Details# Be an award-winning boss and learn how to curate inclusivity on your teams.
## About this event
Closing the gender and racial opportunity gap is critical to organizations that want to perform better. Having access to opportunities helps widen the pool of talent and provides a space in which women of color can reach their full potential. Companies with employees on diverse and inclusive teams put in more effort. Employees stay longer and demonstrate more commitment. To ensure that women of color are supported in the workplace, gender, and racial bias, and other types of stereotypes have to be understood and confronted.
WHY THIS COURSE MATTERS
Unconscious bias training alone isn't enough to eliminate everyday microaggressions one may experience at work. A series of steps and ongoing efforts are critical to forging an inclusive environment.
KEY COMPONENTS

Learn how to recognize biases common to women of color
Learn bridging building strategies to bring different team members together
Get an overview of up-to-date diversity-equity-inclusion terminology and definitions to grow your DEI toolbox.
